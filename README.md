# nj-symbols
exact computation of nj-symbols

The value of an nj-symbol always is plus or minus\
the square root of a non-negative rational number.\
The square can be computed exactly.\
This is what procedures exact-3j-symbol, exact-6j-symbol and exact-9j-symbol do.\
They return plus or minus the exact square of the value of the nj-symbol.\
The procedures follow formulas found in.

Procedures 3j-symbol, 6j-symbol and 9j-symbol return the value proper of an nj-symbol,
possibly inexact.
